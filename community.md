On this page you can find ways to get help, a list of Feathers related questions that came up before and the changelog and license. Make sure to also head over to the [Express FAQ](http://expressjs.com/faq.html). As already mentioned, since Feathers directly extends Express, everything there applies to Feathers as well.

## Getting help

If you have any questions, feel free to post them on our [Gitter channel](https://gitter.im/feathersjs/feathers), submit them as a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/feathersjs/feathers/issues) or on [Stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com) using the [feathersjs](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/feathersjs) tag. We are also on [Slack](https://feathersjs.slack.com/) and on IRC in the [#feathersjs](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=feathersjs) channel on Freenode.

We are also collecting tutorials and news on Medium in the ["All About FeathersJS"](https://medium.com/all-about-feathersjs) publication.
